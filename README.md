# OVRUI Pre-Release

OVRUI is a toolkit that simplifies the development of WebVR applications and interfaces. It contains logic for interfacing with VR headsets, gathering input from a variety of web platforms, and rendering crisp text in 3D space.

There's no code here yet—we're only releasing a very early preview for now—but we want to gather community feedback as soon as possible. In the meantime, we're using the issues tracker on this repository to get your input on bugs and documentation as we prepare for a full release. It may be a bit unorthodox, but we want to get this preview in the hands of developers as soon as possible, and GitHub issues are a great way to collect feedback from the community. On our end, we're actively working to solidify APIs, improve the developer experience, and prepare for external contributions. Our hope is that within a short span of time, we'll have a production-ready product that you can use to deliver VR experiences on the web.

## Will My Web Browser Support My VR Headset?

The [WebVR spec](https://w3c.github.io/webvr/) is currently in development, and it will be some time before browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and Edge begin supporting it in stable releases. In the meantime, you can download the [Carmel Developer Preview](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/gear-vr/1290985657630933/) from Oculus on a Samsung device supporting Gear VR or an [experimental build of Chrome or Firefox](https://webvr.info/) on your Windows PC.
